# VRDL2019FALL Instance Segmentation
This is an assignment of implement instance segementation on tiny pascal voc dataset with 1349 labeled image and 100 tested image.
I had implement the task base on two backbone modules:
1. Mask RCNN, from https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN
2. Detectron2(windows build), from https://github.com/conansherry/detectron2
However since the first one is not I had not proper fine-tuned and it did not perform well yet, I would like to only focus on dectron2.
